**## Project Overview**

This project outlines the steps involved in building a data pipeline that ingests, processes, and stores real-time stock market data. We'll leverage the following technologies:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Cloud Platform:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* **Data Storage:** S3 (Simple Storage Service)
* **Data Querying:** Athena
* **Data Catalog and Crawling:** Glue Catalog and Glue Crawler
* **Compute Resources:** EC2
* **Real-Time Messaging:** Apache Kafka


**## Prerequisites**

* An AWS account with appropriate permissions for the services used.
* Familiarity with Python programming.
* Basic understanding of Apache Kafka concepts.
* Experience with AWS services (S3, Athena, Glue, EC2) is beneficial.
